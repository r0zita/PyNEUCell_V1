# PyNEUCell_V1
PyNEUCell is a Python framework for coupling NEURON electrophysiology with MCell4 reaction–diffusion simulations to model nerve terminal function for mouse NMJ
The current reference model targets the mouse neuromuscular junction, while the framework is designed to support other species and synaptic systems.
