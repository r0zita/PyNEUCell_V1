# PyNEUCell_V1

PyNEUCell is a Python framework for coupling NEURON electrophysiology with MCell4 reaction–diffusion simulations to model nerve terminal function for the mouse neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

---

## Overview

Here we use **physiologically realistic, dynamically changing action potentials** to control molecular simulations, enabling a tight coupling between membrane electrophysiology and stochastic chemical dynamics.

The current reference implementation models the **mouse neuromuscular junction (NMJ)**, where precise spike timing and waveform shape critically influence synaptic transmission.  
While the present models focus on the mouse NMJ, the framework itself is **species-agnostic** and designed to be extended to other synaptic systems.

## Ion Channel Model

The presynaptic active zone is modeled using an explicit, state-based description of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels.

### Active Zone Organization

- **6 active zones**
- Each active zone contains:
  - **4 voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs)**
  - **4 SK channels**
  - **2 docked synaptic vesicles**

All channels are immobile and confined to the presynaptic membrane.

### Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels (VGCCs)

Each VGCC is represented by a multi-state Markov model with the following membrane-bound states:

- `closed`
- `closed2`
- `closed3`
- `open1`
- `open2`

State transitions between closed and open states are governed by **time-dependent rate functions** derived from NEURON-simulated action potentials.

#### Gating Transitions

For each active zone and channel, the following transitions are defined:

- `closed ⇄ closed2`
- `closed2 ⇄ closed3`
- `closed3 ⇄ open1`
- `open1 ⇄ open2`

Transitions among closed states and the initial opening transition are controlled by **NEURON-derived variable rates**, while transitions between open states use fixed rate constants.

---

### Action Potential–Driven Calcium Release

Calcium entry occurs when a VGCC is in an open state (`open1` or `open2`).  
Each action potential waveform produces a **distinct calcium species**, allowing multiple spikes to be tracked independently.

For each channel and action potential index:

- `open → open + Ca²⁺`

Calcium release rates are **time-varying** and are read from precomputed NEURON rate tables stored in `NEURON_RATES/`.

This design allows realistic action potential waveforms—not square pulses—to directly control calcium influx.

---

### SK (Small-Conductance Potassium) Channels

Each active zone also contains **4 SK channels**, positioned with a small lateral offset from the corresponding VGCCs.

SK channels are modeled using a calcium-dependent gating scheme with the following states:

- `closed`
- `closed2`
- `closed3`
- `closed4`
- `open1`
- `open2`

#### Calcium-Dependent Gating

SK channel activation is driven by local calcium concentration:

- Forward transitions between closed states require calcium binding
- Reverse transitions release calcium back into the local pool

This allows SK channels to respond dynamically to calcium microdomains generated by nearby VGCCs.

#### Calcium-Independent Gating

Final transitions between closed and open states are calcium-independent and governed by fixed rate constants.

---

### Functional Coupling

Together, VGCCs and SK channels form a tightly coupled system in which:

- Action potentials control VGCC gating and calcium entry
- Local calcium activates SK channels
- SK channel opening provides feedback regulation of excitability

This channel model enables realistic simulation of spike-driven calcium dynamics and local feedback at the neuromuscular junction.
